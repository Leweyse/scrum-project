## **Description**
G-Bay is an E-commerce Site for fans. As a buyer, you'll be able to create an account, edit your profile, filter results, and more. As a seller, you'll be able to see your listing of products, update their information, or remove them.

[React JS][reactjs] is used for Client-Side, [Laravel 8][laravel] as API, and [MySQL][mysql] as Database Service. In addition, [SCSS][sass] is used to style this project, but SCSS modules are not implemented.

The folder structure for the React App is based on this [article][folder].

[Package manager][pm]:
- React App: [yarn][pm-yarn]
- Laravel API: [composer][pm-composer]

## **Configuration Guide**
This project is not hosted online, but it's completely functional. To use G-Bay on your local device, it's necessary  to follow some steps.

### **Requirements**
1. a) Install PHP on your computer. We recommend using XAMPP for this purpose, as the process is straightforward and you can complete it in a few minutes.

1. b) Should you chose to install PHP manually, after configuring your installation and php.ini file, install MySQL and a database administration tool of your choice (e.g., DBeaver, Datagrip) for setting up the project database and configuring your SQL server.

2. Download and Install the latest version of Composer.

3. Install `yarn` package manager.

4. If you'd like to make style changes, be sure to configure or enable an SCSS compiler to be able to edit each component's stylesheets.
